# hello-world
first github repository


Good afternoon GitHub! I'm editing this as part of the hello world tutorial I am doing before I start the CS50 course on the edx website. My name is Becky, I'm learning about some of the basics for computer science and coding as I am potentially interested in either a career change or a way to make parts of my current job a bit easier. I enjoy reading, video games and watching football (soccer for any Americans who happen to be reading - unlikely but at least it's there if you do!).
